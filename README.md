# Hotel-Booking
A web project that implements a Hotel Booking site.

This project isn't finished get! Only the front end of the website is ready, I am currently working on the back end. At the end, it will be a fully functional booking site, in witch the user will be able to fill in all the necessary filters and find the best hotel for him.
